        <h2>About Penguins</h2>
        <p>Penguins are a group of flightless seabirds belonging to the family Spheniscidae. They are highly specialized for life in marine environments, with streamlined bodies and flipper-like wings that allow them to “fly” through water with remarkable speed and precision. Unlike most birds, penguins have dense bones that reduce buoyancy, aiding in deep diving and underwater maneuverability.</p>
        <br>
        <p>These birds inhabit regions of the Southern Hemisphere, from the icy coasts of Antarctica to temperate islands near the equator. Species such as the Emperor Penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) thrive in extreme cold, while others, like the Galápagos Penguin (Spheniscus mendiculus), live in much warmer climates.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Penguins feed primarily on small marine organisms including fish, krill, and squid. Their diet and breeding success are closely linked to ocean conditions, making them important indicators of ecosystem health and climate change.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Although penguins are well-adapted to their environments, many species face challenges from habitat loss, overfishing, and shifting sea ice patterns. Conservation efforts aim to protect their breeding grounds and ensure the stability of the marine food webs they depend on.</p>
